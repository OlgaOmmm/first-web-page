					<h3><span class="pinktext">Dog</span> chases</h3>
					<p>
						The dog obtains food by driven hunting and does not worry about the smell. Dirty paws after a walk is a headache exclusively for the owner. Dogs are long-distance runners. They are guided by the sense of smell - they search for prey on the trail, as well as hearing and speed. They see in the dark, but the visual picture fades into the background. Their vision is not binocular, as in humans. Each eye shows a separate image, so dogs cannot distinguish fine details. Dogs become attached to the leader, not to the house. The leader knows where and how to get food. Even the most spoiled dog sleeps on the bed not of his own free will, but with the permission of the owner. The cat falls apart wherever it pleases. The dog is happy to be caressed by the owner at any time.

					<h3><span class="pinktext">Cat</span> lies in wait</h3>
					<p>
						The cat hunts from an ambush, where the main qualities are the surprise of the attack and the accuracy of the jump. In order not to discover itself ahead of time, the cat removes the smell. Cleanliness is the key to her survival. Cats still wash, wash, and lick all day. The coloring of the lurking predators is variegated, camouflage - a play of light and shadow. The claws are retracted to move silently. The jump is short and strong, they do not run long distances, the hunting territory is not too large. At home your pussy will surely try on any box, basin, bag, newspaper that falls on the floor. Vision plays a huge role. For an accurate jump, you need to see the prey. Cat's eyes are adapted to darkness, the pupil dilates, and in the light, it narrows into a slit.
